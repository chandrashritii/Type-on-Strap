# SHRITI CHANDRA
<hr>
<br>
## TECHNICAL WRITING PORTFOLIO
<br>
Hello! My name is Shriti Chandra. I’m a freshman doing my undergrad degree in engineering.<br>
Welcome to my technical writing portfolio. I’m a diverse writer based in India. I am  majorly interested in technology and its implications. I have been working with open source organizations, contributing to their documentation and on my blog.<br>
Growing up learning about new technologies, new languages and volunteering for a variety of causes really sparked my interest for story telling and giving back to the community.
<br>
<br>
## EXPERIENCE
### Opensource
### VLC (VideoLAN)
<br>
*May 2020 - PRESENT*
<br>
I have worked with the VideoLan community on migrating and rewriting the [VLC 3.0 User Guide](https://docs.videolan.me/vlc-user/3.0/en/) from [wiki pages](https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:User_Guide/) to the Gitlab platform using Sphinx, Markdown and rST.
<br>
* [OS Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.videolan.me/vlc-user/3.0/en/reference/os_compatibility.html) : I had to migrate the existing documentation, as well as add support for all recent versions of all the Operating Systems supported  by VLC. Merged [here](https://code.videolan.org/docs/vlc-user/-/merge_requests/30).
<br>
* [Archlinux](https://docs.videolan.me/vlc-user/3.0/en/gettingstarted/setup/linux/archlinux.html) : I wrote the following page from scratch, which gave me the opportunity to learn and research a lot as the process had not been documented before. Merged [here](https://code.videolan.org/docs/vlc-user/-/merge_requests/45).

<br>

### Layer5:
<br>
*June 2020 - PRESENT*
<br>
I am an active open source contributor and member of the Layer5 community, which is a SMI network analysis platform, under the umbrella organization, Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).<br>
My contributions have included revamping, re-styling, and/or writing the following pages using Jekyll, Markdown, HTML and CSS:
<br>
* Propagated info on the MeshMates Program, an onboarding welcome program initiated by the  Layer5 community. This involved getting to know the members of the community and doing research to figure out how the program  worked and updating all the appropriate documents. Merged [here](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/pull/1176).
<br>
* Updated command descriptions for a new system command for mesheryctl, one of the central programs under Layer5. This had not been documented before. Merged [here](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/pull/1170).
<br>
* Added a description of one of the recently launched projects under Layer5, Image hub. Merged [here](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/450).
