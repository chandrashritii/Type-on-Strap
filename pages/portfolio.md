# SHRITI CHANDRA
<hr>
<br>

## TECHNICAL WRITING PORTFOLIO

<br>
Hello! My name is Shriti Chandra. I’m a freshman doing my undergrad degree in electronics and communication.<br>
Welcome to my portfolio. I’m a diverse writer based in India, majorly interested in technology and its implications. 
Growing up learning about new technologies, new languages and volunteering for a variety of causes really sparked my interest for story telling and giving back to the community.<br>
Over the past year, I have been working with open source organizations, contributing to their documentation and code. I have also been working on writing blogs on technologies that I have worked with and am well versed in. Check out [A guide to Sphinx.](https://chandrashritii.github.io/blog/2020/06/28/A-guide-to-Sphinx.html)<br>

## EXPERIENCE

### Opensource

#### Google Season of Docs'2020:

<br><br>
<b>Accepted as a Technical Writer for Google Season of Docs’2020 with CNCF </b><br /> 
The accepted project goals include:
* Improving the user and dev documentation

* Create hands on tutorials to facilitate better understanding and improved working environments for users to assess their service mesh and compare them against the industry standard, the ServiceMesh Interface (SMI) and Service Mesh Performance (SMP) specifications using the service mesh management plane - Meshery as a platform


#### Layer5:
*June 2020 - PRESENT*
<br><br>
I am an active open source contributor and member of the Layer5 community, which is a service mesh analysis platform, under the umbrella organization, Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).<br>
My contributions have included:

2. Worked with a three member team on a web development project and createded a project website from scratch:
  * The live site can be found [here](https://smp-spec.io/). PR merged: [#57](https://github.com/layer5io/service-mesh-performance-specification/pull/57)

3. Working on a CLI interface ’mesheryctl’ to introduce and incorporate new commands and capture corner cases, in an effort to improve the user experience
 

#### VLC (VideoLAN)
*May 2020 - PRESENT*
<br><br>
I have worked with the VideoLan community on migrating and rewriting the [VLC 3.0 User Guide](https://docs.videolan.me/vlc-user/3.0/en/) from [wiki pages](https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:User_Guide/) to the Gitlab platform using Sphinx, Markdown and rST.
<br>

1. [OS Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.videolan.me/vlc-user/3.0/en/reference/os_compatibility.html) : I had to migrate the existing documentation, as well as add support for all recent versions of all the Operating Systems supported  by VLC. Merged [here](https://code.videolan.org/docs/vlc-user/-/merge_requests/30).
<br>

2. [Archlinux](https://docs.videolan.me/vlc-user/3.0/en/gettingstarted/setup/linux/archlinux.html) : I wrote the following page from scratch, which gave me the opportunity to learn and research a lot as the process had not been documented before. Merged [here](https://code.videolan.org/docs/vlc-user/-/merge_requests/45).
